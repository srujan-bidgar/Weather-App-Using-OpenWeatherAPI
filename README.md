# Weather-App-Using-OpenWeatherAPI

- This repository contains the source code for a simple yet powerful weather application that allows users to check the current weather conditions and forecasts for various locations
  
# Features
- Up-to-date information about the current weather conditions for a specific location, including temperature, humidity, wind speed,etc by inputing just the location name
- User friendly and minimalistic interface which is easy to use

# Learnings
- [x] Integrating weather data from external APIs(OpenWeather API), learning how to make asynchronous requests
- [x] Managing sensitive information, such as API keys
- [x] Implementing a simple yet efficient design using styling

 # Challenges
 - [x] Making asynchronous API requests to fetch weather data and ensuring the app remains responsive presented a significant challenge.
       (solution:leveraging JavaScript's asynchronous capabilities and the async/await syntax to ensure that API requests did not block the main thread.)
 - [x] Safeguarding API keys and other sensitive information from potential exposure in the codebase
       (solution: We used environment variables to store and protect sensitive data like API keys.)
